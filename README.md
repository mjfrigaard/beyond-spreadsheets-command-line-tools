`pwd` - print working directory   
`cd` - change directories

`ls` - list all files  
`head` - print top of file 
`tail` - print bottom of file

`mkdir` - create directory  
`touch` - create a few files  


`ls -la` - list all files, including hidden ones  
`rmdir` - remove a directory  (*EXTRA*)
`cat` - display a text file in Terminal screen  (*EXTRA*)

`grep` - globally search a regular expression and print  

`>> and > `- redirect output of program to a file (donâ€™t display on Terminal screen)

`curl` - download stuff from the INTERNET

`sudo` and `sudo -s` (BE CAREFUL!!) performing commands as root user can carry some heavy consequences. (*EXTRA*)
