## Topics covered

`echo` - outputs text as arguments, prints to Terminal screen, file, or in a pipeline

`pwd` - print working directory   
`cd` - change directories    
`whoami` - user/login info   
`ls` - list all files  
`head` - print top of file   
`tail` - print bottom of file

`mkdir` - create directory  
`touch` - create a few files  


`ls -la` - list all files, including hidden ones   
`rmdir` - remove a directory  (*EXTRA*)   
`cat` - display a text file in Terminal screen  (*EXTRA*)   

`grep` - globally search a regular expression and print   

`>> and > `- redirect output of program to a file (donâ€™t display on Terminal screen)

`sudo` and `sudo -s` (BE CAREFUL!!) performing commands as root user can carry some heavy consequences. (*EXTRA*)
